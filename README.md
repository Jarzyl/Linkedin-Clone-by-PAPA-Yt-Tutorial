# Linkedin-Clone-by-PAPA-Yt-Tutorial

As part of learning how to create an advanced react application, I used a recommended tutorial created by Sonny Sangha (known as PAPA React).

Thanks to the linkedin clone tutorial, I understood the construction of the application in react, how redux works, how firebase works and how to combine it all together so that the website has the functionality of logging in, logging out, saving users and adding posts.

This is a good introduction to the subject.

I will create my own idea, an extended clone of the current Linkedin (March 2023) using Next.js and Talilwind CSS and combine it with Redux and Firebas.
